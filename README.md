Here is a Java project written for the Coursera online [course](https://mx.coursera.org/learn/introduccion-java) of [Elisa Viso Gurovich](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/elisa-viso) and modified by me. Its pourpuse is to ilustrate and put hands on the best progamming practices of OOP, Javadoc docummentation and demonstrate how easy it is to scale a large project using this paradigm.  

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains three folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `bin`: the folder to contain the compiled output files 
- `doc`: the folder to maintain Javadoc docummentation

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## How does it work
